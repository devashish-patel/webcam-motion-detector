# Webcam Motion Detector
- Open Source Computer Vision based personal project to detect Human Faces and different objects coming in front of the webcam for a specific time frame.
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: OpenCV, Bokeh, Pandas
- For Human Face detection I've used HaarCascade Classifier XML file created by OpenCV.

###  Overview of Project:

------------
- Before you execute the project, please cover your webcam and remove the cover once your webcam starts and you can see some video recording windows on your desktop.
- You will see four different windows on your screen.
 - Color Frame: Which detects the different objects
 - Current Frame: Which detects the human face
 - Delta Frame*: Which compares the current situation the with the initial situation 
 - Threshold frame* - for identification of an object 
 - *not important for end-user
