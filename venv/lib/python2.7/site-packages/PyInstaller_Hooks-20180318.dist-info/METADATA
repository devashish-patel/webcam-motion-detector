“Hook” file for PyInstaller
==================================

This package includes the “hook” files extending PyInstaller to adapt it to
the special needs and methods used by a Python package.

PyInstaller bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single
package. The user can run the packaged app without installing a Python
interpreter or any modules.
